# Celebal-Kaggle-Challenge

## Overview
The goal of this challenge is to predict anomalies based on sensor readings using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Objectives
- Work with tabular data to identify and predict anomalies.
- Showcase skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building robust predictive models.
- Deliver a complete solution in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Evaluation Criteria
The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing (20%)
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Performing feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
- Conducting correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.

### Modeling (60%)
- Applying classical machine learning models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
- Leveraging advanced models such as:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - CatBoost
  - Neural Networks
- Providing justification for model selection and explaining hyperparameter tuning strategies.

### Model Evaluation (20%)
- Using appropriate evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
- Conducting robustness checks such as backtesting and residual analysis.

---

## Deliverables
- Submit a **Jupyter Notebook** containing:
  - Code implementation.
  - Explanatory comments and markdown cells for documentation.
- Ensure the notebook is well-documented and includes all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
